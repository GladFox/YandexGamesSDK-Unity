# Setting Up Local Development Server

The local development server enables testing WebGL builds and SDK features in a simulated Yandex environment directly from Unity. Follow these steps to configure and troubleshoot your local server setup.

**1. Access the Local Server Settings**

* Open the **Yandex Games SDK Dashboard** within Unity.

**2. Specify Build Path and Server Port**

* **WebGL Build Path**: Set the path to your WebGL build output.
* **Server Port**: Enter your preferred port for the server (e.g., `8080`).

**3. Start the Local Server**

* Click **"Start Server"** to launch the local development environment.
* This server simulates Yandex Games interactions, allowing you to test SDK features without needing a live connection.
